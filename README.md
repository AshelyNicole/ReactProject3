### Tetris

Bring down blocks from the top of the screen. You can move the blocks around, either left to right and/or you can rotate them. Your objective is to get all the blocks to fill all the empty space in a line at the bottom of the screen; whenever you do this, youâ€™ll find that the blocks vanish and you get awarded some points.
